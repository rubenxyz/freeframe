# Changelog

All notable changes to FreeFrame are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.3.1] - 2026-07-08

### Added
- **Version-aware public share player** ([#120](https://github.com/Techiebutler/freeframe/issues/120)) — on folder/project/multi-share links with **Show all versions** enabled, the shared asset viewer now shows a version switcher; selecting a version swaps the streamed media and scopes comments to that version. Previously only the latest version played and comments from every version were shown regardless of the selection. The folder/grid preview (which has no version picker) now scopes its comment list — and each asset card's comment count — to the latest ready version instead of counting/showing every version's comments. New guest endpoint `GET /share/{token}/assets/{asset_id}/versions` (exposes all ready versions only when the link enables version history, otherwise just the latest); `GET /share/{token}/stream/{asset_id}` and `GET /share/{token}/comments` now accept an optional `version_id` (comments also accept `latest_only`). The separate single-asset custom-player path is tracked in [#123](https://github.com/Techiebutler/freeframe/issues/123).
- **Share preview cards show a version-count badge and duration chip** — each asset card in the folder/grid share preview now shows a "⧉ N" badge when the asset has multiple ready versions, and the multi-share preview path now passes through media duration and file size (the duration chip renders once media duration is populated — currently blocked by [#124](https://github.com/Techiebutler/freeframe/issues/124)).

### Fixed
- **Passphrase-protected share previews no longer show "No content yet"** ([#119](https://github.com/Techiebutler/freeframe/issues/119)) — the public `/share/{token}/assets` and `/share/{token}/thumbnail/{asset_id}` endpoints now honor the authenticated link creator's passphrase bypass (matching `/share/{token}/stream/{asset_id}`), so the dashboard settings preview loads a password-protected link's assets instead of rendering an empty state.
- **Video version switcher now plays the selected version's stream** ([#66](https://github.com/Techiebutler/freeframe/issues/66)) — the review player fetched `/assets/{id}/stream` without a `version_id`, so switching versions updated the dropdown but the `<video>` kept playing the latest version's stream. The player now pins the stream to the selected version and re-fetches (resetting playback) when the version changes.
- **New asset versions appear without a hard refresh, with an in-progress indicator** ([#118](https://github.com/Techiebutler/freeframe/issues/118)) — the review screen now revalidates the version list from transcode SSE events instead of a single best-effort timer, so a freshly uploaded version shows up and advances through uploading → processing → ready on its own. The version switcher trigger now surfaces a spinner/label while a new version is still uploading or processing (previously that status was only visible inside the dropdown).

## [1.3.0] - 2026-07-07

### Upgrade notes

New garbage-collection features for [#65](https://github.com/Techiebutler/freeframe/issues/65), all with safe defaults — nothing runs unless you run `celery beat`, and the destructive parts are opt-in:

- **Retention GC activates if you run `celery beat`.** A daily `cleanup_soft_deleted` job hard-deletes rows soft-deleted longer than `SOFT_DELETE_RETENTION_DAYS` (default `30`) and deletes their S3 objects, cascading the full project→folder→asset→version→media/comment/share tree. Set `SOFT_DELETE_RETENTION_DAYS=0` to disable.
- **The S3 orphan sweeper is off and report-only by default.** It runs only when `ORPHAN_SWEEP_GRACE_HOURS > 0`, and even then only *reports* bucket objects with no DB row — it deletes only if you also set `ORPHAN_SWEEP_DELETE=true`. Review its report-only logs before enabling deletion.
- **No migration required** — the GC reuses the existing `deleted_at` columns.
- **New optional env vars, all safe-by-default:** `SOFT_DELETE_RETENTION_DAYS=30`, `ORPHAN_SWEEP_GRACE_HOURS=0` (disabled), `ORPHAN_SWEEP_DELETE=false` (report-only).

### Added
- **Retention-window garbage collection** ([#65](https://github.com/Techiebutler/freeframe/issues/65)) — a daily `cleanup_soft_deleted` job hard-deletes rows soft-deleted longer than `SOFT_DELETE_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 30, `0` disables) and reclaims their S3 objects, cascading through projects, folders, assets, versions, media, comments, approvals, and share links. Long-expired share links are swept into soft-delete first. No effect unless you run `celery beat`.
- **S3 orphan sweeper** ([#65](https://github.com/Techiebutler/freeframe/issues/65)) — an opt-in weekly `sweep_orphan_s3` job reclaims bucket objects under `raw/`/`processed/` that no `MediaFile` row references. **Off and report-only by default**: set `ORPHAN_SWEEP_GRACE_HOURS` > 0 to enable (only keys older than that window are considered, so active uploads are never touched) and `ORPHAN_SWEEP_DELETE=true` to actually delete (otherwise it just logs what it would reclaim). No effect unless you run `celery beat`.
- **Manual `POST /admin/purge` endpoint** — superadmin-only; triggers the retention collector to run in the background (returns `202`); reclaimed counts are logged by the worker.

### Changed
- **`POST /assets/{id}/restore` and `/folders/{id}/restore` now return `409`** when the item's project has been deleted — a deleted project has no restore path, so there is nothing to restore into.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-07

### Upgrade notes

Upgrading from v1.1.6 is non-breaking by default (the new storage cap and per-file limit both default to unlimited), but note:

- **Run `alembic upgrade head`.** This adds the `instance_settings` table and widens `MediaFile.file_size_bytes` / `CommentAttachment.file_size_bytes` to `BigInteger`. ⚠️ The bigint change **rewrites the `media_files` and `comment_attachments` tables under an `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` lock** (int4→int8 is not an in-place change in PostgreSQL), blocking reads and writes for the duration of the rewrite. Negligible on small installs; on a large `media_files` table, **run it during a low-traffic maintenance window.**
- **The upload reaper activates if you run `celery beat`.** An hourly job aborts stale, still-open S3 multipart uploads and soft-deletes `uploading`/`failed` versions older than `STALE_UPLOAD_TIMEOUT_HOURS` (default `24`), deleting their S3 objects. Raise the value to be more conservative, or set it to `0` to disable. No effect if you don't run `celery beat`.
- **New optional env vars, both with safe defaults:** `MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES=0` (unlimited per-file size) and `STALE_UPLOAD_TIMEOUT_HOURS=24`.
- **No behavior change until you opt in** — set an instance storage cap via the admin **Instance settings** tab (or `PUT /instance/settings`) when you want to enforce one.

### Added
- **Storage cap admin UI + sidebar indicator** ([#102](https://github.com/Techiebutler/freeframe/pull/102)) — the global sidebar shows instance storage `used / limit` with a meter (amber ≥80%, red ≥90%); admins set the cap in GB (`0` = unlimited) in a new **Instance settings** sub-tab on the admin settings page. Frontend for the #98 storage cap.
- **Automatic reclamation of stuck/failed upload storage** ([#101](https://github.com/Techiebutler/freeframe/pull/101)) — a scoped slice of #65: an hourly job aborts stale, still-open S3 multipart uploads and soft-deletes `uploading`/`failed` versions older than `STALE_UPLOAD_TIMEOUT_HOURS` (default 24), reclaiming their S3 objects. Prevents unbounded storage leak from interrupted/failed uploads that the committed-only cap doesn't count.
- **Instance settings + instance-wide storage cap** ([#98](https://github.com/Techiebutler/freeframe/pull/98)) — new admin-editable `instance_settings` singleton table (the home for deployment-level settings on this single-tenant instance), with an instance-wide total-storage cap as its first setting. `GET /instance/settings` (any member) returns `storage_limit_bytes` + current `storage_used_bytes`; `PUT /instance/settings` (admin) sets the limit (`0` = unlimited). The cap is enforced at upload initiate alongside the per-file `MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES` check; usage counts committed (processing/ready), non-deleted media. Backend only — admin UI + storage indicator to follow.
- **Configurable per-file upload limit** ([#64](https://github.com/Techiebutler/freeframe/issues/64)) — new `MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES` env var caps the size of a single uploaded file (`0` = unlimited, the new default). Replaces the hardcoded 10GB ceiling that self-hosters running their own S3/MinIO had no way to change or remove. Enforced at both upload-initiation points (`POST /upload/initiate` and new-version upload) with an error that reports the configured cap instead of a hardcoded "10GB". Effective size is still structurally bounded by S3 multipart (10,000 parts × 10MB chunk ≈ 97GB).

### Fixed
- **Per-project storage figure now matches the instance cap accounting** ([#100](https://github.com/Techiebutler/freeframe/pull/100)) — the per-project storage number on the project page now counts only committed (`processing`/`ready`), non-deleted media — excluding in-progress/failed/deleted uploads — consistent with the instance-wide storage cap (#98).
- **Files larger than ~2.1 GB could not be recorded** ([#99](https://github.com/Techiebutler/freeframe/pull/99)) — `MediaFile.file_size_bytes` and `CommentAttachment.file_size_bytes` were `INTEGER` (int4, ~2.1 GB ceiling), so a file above that size overflowed on insert despite per-file uploads being nominally unlimited ([#64]). Both columns are now `BigInteger`.
- **Misleading "Storage X / 10 GB" indicator on the project page** ([#64](https://github.com/Techiebutler/freeframe/issues/64)) — the project sidebar rendered a hardcoded 10 GB denominator with 80%/90% color warnings, implying a per-project quota that never existed as a real, configurable concept. It now shows only storage used — no fake denominator, no progress bar.

## [1.1.6] - 2026-07-06

### Fixed
- **HLS video playback on the public share page in Chrome/Firefox** ([#68](https://github.com/Techiebutler/freeframe/issues/68)) — `ShareMediaViewer` used a plain `<video src={streamUrl}>`, which only plays HLS (`.m3u8`) natively in Safari and failed in Chrome/Firefox. It now uses hls.js (already a project dependency) for MediaSource-capable browsers, falling back to native playback for Safari and direct media files; the same pattern was applied to the audio branch. ([#76](https://github.com/Techiebutler/freeframe/pull/76))
- **Public share comments response shape** ([#67](https://github.com/Techiebutler/freeframe/issues/67), [#72](https://github.com/Techiebutler/freeframe/issues/72)) — `GET /share/{token}/comments` now returns a consistent bare array on the no-target fallback path, and the single-asset share page handles the response robustly (aligned with the folder share viewer). Adds backend regression coverage for asset-share, folder/project-share, and no-target fallback paths. ([#70](https://github.com/Techiebutler/freeframe/pull/70), [#73](https://github.com/Techiebutler/freeframe/pull/73))

### Dependencies
- Bump `redis` (apps/api) from 5.1.0 to 5.3.1 ([#30](https://github.com/Techiebutler/freeframe/pull/30))
- Bump `pnpm/action-setup` from 5 to 6 (CI) ([#58](https://github.com/Techiebutler/freeframe/pull/58))

---

## [1.1.5] - 2026-04-14

### Security
- **HLS video streams now route through the API proxy so S3 objects can stay private** ([#51](https://github.com/Techiebutler/freeframe/issues/51)) — the `/stream/hls/{path}` proxy router was already built and registered in `main.py` but was never actually called. `GET /assets/{id}/stream`, `GET /share/{token}`, and `GET /share/{token}/stream/{asset_id}` all previously handed out a direct presigned URL to `master.m3u8`, which forced the HLS player to fetch variant playlists and `.ts` segments as unsigned requests — only working on buckets with public-read ACL. Non-AWS providers (Exoscale SOS, Cloudflare R2, etc.) do not inherit bucket-level ACL on new objects, so processed files returned 403 Forbidden. The three stream endpoints now mint a short-lived HLS JWT scoped to the asset's S3 prefix and return `/stream/hls/master.m3u8?token=…`; the proxy rewrites variant playlist URLs to stay inside the proxy (with the same token) and rewrites segment URLs to freshly-presigned S3 URLs. Result: the bucket can stay fully private on every S3-compatible provider, captured segment URLs expire in 24h instead of living forever via public-read, and a leaked master URL can't be replayed after its token expires. Token and segment presign TTLs both bumped from 4h to 24h so pause-and-resume works without refresh logic. Includes regression tests for the assets, share asset detail, and share stream endpoints.

---

## [1.1.4] - 2026-04-13

### Fixed
- **Share endpoint returned folder path instead of master.m3u8 for video stream URLs** ([#45](https://github.com/Techiebutler/freeframe/issues/45)) — `GET /share/{token}` was building video stream URLs from `MediaFile.s3_key_processed` (the HLS folder prefix) without appending `/master.m3u8`, so share viewers received a folder URL instead of the playlist. Mirrors the existing fix already applied in `get_share_stream_url` and `assets.py`. Includes regression tests for both the video and image paths.
- **Dashboard crash on upload with relative `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`** ([#46](https://github.com/Techiebutler/freeframe/issues/46)) — `useSSE` called `new URL(`${API_URL}/events/${projectId}`)` without a base. When `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` was set to a relative path like `/api` (typical for nginx-proxied deployments), the URL constructor threw `TypeError: Failed to construct 'URL': Invalid URL` the moment `UploadSSEBridge` opened its first SSE connection — crashing the dashboard immediately after any upload. Now passes `window.location.origin` as the base URL so relative paths resolve. Includes a regression test.

---

## [1.1.3] - 2026-04-11

### Fixed
- **Missing file extensions on download** ([#41](https://github.com/Techiebutler/freeframe/issues/41)) — downloaded assets were saving without an extension (e.g. `Video_Title` instead of `Video_Title.mp4`). The API now derives the extension from `MediaFile.original_filename` (authoritative) or the S3 key and appends it to `asset.name` when missing, for both `/assets/{id}/stream` and `/share/{token}/stream/{asset_id}`. The dashboard Download button now uses `?download=true` + a hidden iframe, and the share viewer no longer overrides `a.download`, so the browser honors the server's `Content-Disposition` filename.

---

## [1.1.2] - 2026-04-10

### Fixed
- **Asset downloads** ([#35](https://github.com/Techiebutler/freeframe/issues/35)) — download buttons were serving HLS `.m3u8` playlist files instead of the original media. Stream endpoints now accept `?download=true` and return a presigned URL to the raw file (or the processed file for images/audio) with `Content-Disposition: attachment` so the browser saves it with the correct filename.
- **Share link "Download All"** now recursively walks the share folder tree and downloads assets from all subfolders — previously only downloaded assets at the current level.
- **Bulk download in project view** — the Download button in the bulk actions bar now appears when only folders are selected, and selecting folders recursively downloads their assets.
- **Share link download permission** — the stream endpoint now enforces `allow_download` and logs `downloaded` activity separately from `viewed_asset`.
- **Upload dialog file list** — selecting multiple files now shows a clean per-file list with individual sizes (KB/MB) instead of a single concatenated string.
- **Dev environment** — `docker-compose.dev.yml` web service bumped from `node:18-alpine` to `node:20-alpine` (required by current frontend dependencies).

---

## [1.1.1] - 2026-04-04

### Security
- **Setup guard middleware** — all API routes return 503 and frontend redirects to `/setup` until initial superadmin is created. Exempt: `/setup/*`, `/health`, `/docs`, `/share/*`. Cached after first check for zero overhead.

### Fixed
- Branch protection `lock_branch` was preventing PR merges — unlocked while keeping review requirement

---

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-03

### Security
- **Global rate limiting** — 600 read / 300 write requests per minute per user/IP with Redis sliding window
- **Per-endpoint rate limits** on sensitive routes: magic code (5/10min), verify (10/10min), share validation (30/min), setup (3/10min)
- **Secure HLS streaming proxy** — token-authenticated manifest rewriting with directory traversal prevention
- **Cryptographic magic codes** — replaced `random.randint` with `secrets.randbelow`
- **Upload authorization hardening** — presign-part, complete, and abort endpoints now verify `created_by` ownership
- **SSE event auth** — token query param support + project membership validation (previously had no access control)
- **Share link password sessions** — 1-hour Redis sessions after password verification so users don't re-enter passwords
- **Multi-share scope enforcement** — share links only expose specifically selected items, not the entire project
- **Rate limiters fail open** — graceful degradation when Redis is unavailable (no 500 errors)
- **CI tamper guards** — minimum test count, critical file checks, and route count assertions prevent PRs that delete tests from passing

### Added
- **Multi-item share links** — select multiple assets/folders and create a single share link (`ShareLinkItem` model + `POST /projects/{id}/share/multi` endpoint)
- **Add asset to existing share link** — `POST /share/{token}/add-asset/{asset_id}` endpoint with dropdown UI in the asset viewer
- **Viewer share button redesign** — dropdown with "New Share Link" + list of existing project share links
- **Inline comment editing** — edit button in comment menu opens textarea, saves via `PATCH /comments/{id}`
- **Copy comment link** — builds URL with `?commentId=` param; opens viewer and highlights the comment
- **Guest user comment flow** — name/email prompt for non-authenticated users on share links, persisted to localStorage
- **Storage indicator** — progress bar in project sidebar showing used / 10 GB with color warnings (amber 80%+, red 90%+)
- **SSE typed events** — `event: type\ndata: payload` format enabling frontend filtering via `EventSource.addEventListener`
- **SSE connection pooling** — Redis `ConnectionPool` prevents connection exhaustion under load
- **Non-blocking Celery dispatch** — background daemon thread so API never blocks on broker connections
- **Token refresh deduplication** — concurrent 401s share a single refresh call, preventing logout races
- **GitHub Actions CI** — 4 parallel jobs: backend tests, frontend build, lint, Docker build
- **CI tamper-proof guards** — minimum test file count (5), minimum passing tests (40), critical file existence checks, route count assertions
- **Docker build CI** — all 4 Dockerfiles (api dev/prod, web dev/prod) built and verified on every PR
- **Dependabot** — automated weekly dependency updates for pip, npm, GitHub Actions, Docker (major versions ignored)
- **Community files** — CONTRIBUTING.md, SECURITY.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, issue templates, PR template
- **GitHub Discussions** enabled
- **10 repo topics** — media-review, frame-io-alternative, self-hosted, fastapi, nextjs, etc.

### Fixed
- Share link viewer 403 errors — share token now flows through `ReviewProvider` → `ImageViewer` / `AudioPlayer` for stream URL fetching
- Password-protected share links — `share_session` threaded through all API calls (assets, stream, comments, thumbnails)
- Share link preview in project page showed all project assets instead of only shared items
- Comment author showing "User" instead of real name in share link sidebar
- Annotation drawing not working on shared assets (missing `AnnotationCanvas` render)
- Canvas annotations not scaling correctly — `_canvasWidth`/`_canvasHeight` stored in JSON for proper coordinate scaling
- Fabric.js not initializing on late-mounted canvas elements — re-bootstrap on drawing mode toggle
- Stale annotations persisting after comment submission — canvas and overlay now cleared
- Video player showing old video while new one loads — `streamUrl` reset to null on asset change
- Relative HLS proxy paths not resolving — API URL prepended for `/stream/hls/` paths
- Image viewer not filling container — `w-full h-full` instead of `inline-flex`
- Stub buttons wired up: Share + Download in fields panel, Assets `+` for new folder
- Right panel toggle hidden on projects listing page (not useful there)
- Main header hidden on asset viewer page (viewer has its own top bar)
- Removed non-functional "More" button from comment panel header
- Settings menu redirects to `/settings/admin` instead of `/settings/profile`
- Existing project members filtered from "Add member" suggestions
- Sidebar overflow in collapsed mode — `overflow-hidden` + `overflow-x-hidden`
- Back to Dashboard redirects to `/projects` instead of `/`
- Project detail endpoint now calculates `storage_bytes`, `asset_count`, `member_count`
- Backend `guest_comment` activity log crash when authenticated user comments via share link
- Pre-existing test failures in `test_auth` and `test_projects` (missing mock fields)
- `playheadTime` and `seekTarget` reset on asset change in review store
- Web Dockerfiles updated to use pnpm + Node 20 (were using npm + Node 18)
- TypeScript annotation errors in test mocks (missing `preferences`, `asset_name`, etc.)

### Changed
- `review-store`: added `setIsDrawingMode()` for explicit control (not just toggle)
- Dependabot configured to skip major version bumps (manual migration only)
- Branch protection: force push disabled on main
